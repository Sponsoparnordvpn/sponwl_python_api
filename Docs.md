# Sponsoparnordvpn's whitelisting service
Welcome to sponwl, it's a python or lua whitelist.


How to use the API ?

# Documentation ðŸ”Œ

First, you need to clone this GitHub, which is not hard to do.
Enter this in your python command prompt
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sponsoparnordvpn/sponwl_python_api
```


Once everything is setup, you will see those files :
main.py
sponwl.py
Docs.md ( delete it )

main.py is actually a blank file, so you can do what you want.


Take a look at sponwl.py for the functions and get your hands ready to code !
